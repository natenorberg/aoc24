# Advent of Code 2024

I'm publishing my AoC journey this year!

### Will I get all the way through?

Probably not. December is busy and I have 4 kids now (as of last month)

### What language am I using?

Mostly Typescript. I might do some of them in Go if I feel like it

### How to run the code?

I'm using [bun](https://bun.sh/) for the runtime. Each day is in it's own folder. Just `cd` into the directory and run `bun run day01.ts` or `bun test day01.test.ts`
